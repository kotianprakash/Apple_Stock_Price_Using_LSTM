# Apple Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
## Introduction

This project aims to predict the future stock prices of Apple Inc. using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The idea is to train a model that can accurately predict the stock prices of Apple Inc. based on its historical stock price data.

## Algorithm
The algorithm used to predict the future stock prices of Apple Inc. is based on LSTM neural networks. Here's how it works:

The program reads in historical stock price data for Apple Inc. from a CSV file.

The program preprocesses the data by normalizing it and splitting it into training and testing sets.

The program trains an LSTM model on the training set to learn the patterns in the historical stock price data.

The program uses the trained LSTM model to predict the future stock prices of Apple Inc. based on the test data.

The program evaluates the performance of the LSTM model by comparing its predictions with the actual stock prices from the test data.

# Conclusion

Apple stock price prediction using LSTM is a powerful technique for forecasting the future stock prices of Apple Inc. This project demonstrates how LSTM neural networks can be used to learn the patterns in historical stock price data and make accurate predictions about future stock prices. With further development and refinement, this technique could be used in real-world applications such as stock trading or portfolio management.
